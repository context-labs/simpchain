# Syncing

Syncing is the process of refreshing your sources to include their most recent content. This ensures your bots have access to the latest information from each respective source, keeping them up-to-date and effective.

## How to Sync a source

<Steps>

### Locate the Source

Click "Sources" in the left-side navigation pane, then find the source that you want to sync and click on it.

### Sync the Source

Click the "Syncing" tab, then find the "Sync Source" button. This will kick off the syncing process, which typically takes 5 minutes or less.

</Steps>

  It's important to note that each time you sync, it uses one of your syncing
  credits. These are part of your [subscription plan](/usage), and are refreshed
  every month.
