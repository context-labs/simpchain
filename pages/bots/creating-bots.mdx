# Creating Bots

Creating a bot on Context is seamless and typically takes less than 5 minutes.

## How To Create A Bot

<Steps>

### Begin Bot Creation

Click "Bots" in the left side navigation panel, and then click "Create Bot" in the top right corner of the screen.

### Enter General Information

**Name your bot:** Choose a display name for your bot that users will see during interactions and that admins will see in the backend.

**Avatar:** Upload a logo to represent your bot, which will be visible to users during interactions. This helps to align your bot with your company or organization's branding.

**Model:** Select the AI/LLM model you prefer to power your bot. GPT-4 is highly recommended due to its superior capabilities; however, it has a slower response time and consumes 20 times more query credits than GPT-3.5. Make your choice based on the desired performance and credit consumption balance.

### Select Your Sources

Sources are collections of documents that your bot will use to answer queries. Add as many sources as desired, as bots can reference multiple sources simultaneously.

If you've already created sources, they will appear in a list.

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

Select a source from the list to serve as a reference for your bot. A checkmark will appear on selected sources. Click again to deselect a source.

Choose as many sources as needed. The bot will draw from all selected sources when answering queries.

### Add FAQs

FAQs are optional pre-filled questions that display when users launch your bot, providing a starting point for common inquiries.

To add an FAQ, enter the question in the dialog box and click "Add FAQ".

Your FAQs will appear below the dialog box, and you can remove them by clicking the "X" button.

### Finalize & Sync

Click the "Create Bot" button at the bottom of the screen to finalize your bot creation. Your bot will begin syncing with the data from your sources, which may take a few minutes or longer, depending on the number of sources.

A "syncing" dialog screen will appear, and once completed, you'll be directed to the bot dashboard.
