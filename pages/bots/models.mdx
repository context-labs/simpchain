# Models

Context uses two different AI models to answer questions accurately in natural human language. They are:

- [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)
- [GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4)

## GPT-3.5

GPT-3.5 model faster and cheaper than GPT-4, and consumes 1 [query credits](/usage) per response, but will likely provide worse answers than GPT-4.

## GPT-4

GPT-4 is slower and consumes 20 [query credits](/usage) per response, but the answers it provides are typically more accurate and provide more context than GPT-3.5.

You can change the model that your bot is using at any time by going to your [Bot Settings](/bots/bot-settings) and adjusting the model dropdown. It's a good idea to test with both models to see which one fits your business better, and which provides the best value for the cost.
