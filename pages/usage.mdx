# Usage

Usage in Context is measured in three different metrics:

- [Query Credits](#query-credits)
- [Documents](#documents)
- [Syncs](#syncs)

Depending on your [Context subscription plan](/pricing), you have different limits for these metrics that are reset once per month. To view your limits, and how much usage you've accrued, go to your [Workspace Settings](/settings) page, and click "Billing".

## Query Credits

Every time a query to your bot is made, it uses Query Credits.

- For GPT-3.5 it costs 1 Query Credit per response
- For GPT-4 it costs 20 Query Credits per response

## Documents

[Documents](/sources/documents) represent the data that is fed to your bot to train it. Each plan has a different number of maximum documents that is allotted. If you try to upload a [source](/sources) that has more documents in it than is permitted on your plan, you will be prompted to upload your [plan](pricing).

## Syncs

[Syncs](/sources/syncing) are the process of refreshing your sources to include their most recent content. You are allotted a certain number of manual syncs per month, and if you attempt to go over the number allocated in your plan, you will be prompted to upgrade.
