# Creating Sources

There are two ways to create a source:

- [During the Bot Creation Process](#during-the-bot-creation-process)
- [From the Source Dashboard](#from-the-source-dashboard)

## During the Bot Creation Process

### Create a bot

To add a source during the bot creation process, navigate to your Bot Dashboard. Click on "Create Bot" situated in the top-right corner. Enter the required general information. Once completed, you will arrive at the "Sources" section.

### Create a new source

Click the “Create New Source” button. Then, select the data type from which you intend to create a source.

### Insert link

In the input field provided, copy and paste the link to your data.

  Note that not all links are compatible. For instance, only YouTube links that
  direct to playlists or channels are supported. Links to individual videos are
  currently unsupported.

### Sync & Finalize

Upon creating the bot, your source will be synchronized and added to your Sources Dashboard. This dashboard can be found by selecting “Sources” on the left-side navigation bar.

</Steps>

### Sync & Finalize

Optionally, you can assign a name to your source, add a brief description, and set an icon logo. To commence the syncing of your source, click the "Add Source" button located at the bottom of the screen.

### Incorporate your Source into a Bot

To utilize your source, you need to add it to a bot. This can be done for any pre-existing bot by visiting the [Bot Settings](/bots/bot-settings) page, selecting "Sources," and clicking on the source you wish to use with the bot. The selected source will be marked with a check, signifying that it is now incorporated into the bot.

Alternatively, during the [bot creation process](/bots/creating-bots), you can add this source to your bot by selecting the source.
