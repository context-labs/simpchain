# Monitor Queries

Monitor incoming queries from your bot in real time to assess their accuracy and gauge user satisfaction.

To do this, click the "Bots" button in the left side navigation, select the bot for which you want to monitor queries, and then click the “Queries” tab located just below the bot name and logo.

A list of the most recent queries, sorted by the order they were received, will be displayed. If a response was rated as helpful or unhelpful, that information will also be shown alongside the query.

Click on any query to expand it and reveal the response provided by Context, as well as a list of references. Click the query again to collapse it.
