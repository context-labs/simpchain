# Documents

Documents represent the individual units of raw data or content that comprise a source. For instance:

- In the context of a website, each webpage is considered a **document**.
- For a YouTube Playlist, each video constitutes a **document**.
- In a PDF, each page is deemed a **document**.

The importance of documents is underscored by the fact that the total number of documents you can have in Context is determined by your [subscription plan](/pricing). Once you reach your document limit, an account upgrade is required for further document additions.

For further information, refer to our sections on [Usage Limits](/usage).
