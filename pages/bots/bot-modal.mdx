# Bot Modal

The Context Bot Modal is a user-friendly interface that can be seamlessly integrated into any website or application, allowing users to interact with a Context bot for real-time support.

The modal is simple and efficient, featuring a single input form where users can submit their questions. After a user enters a question and presses enter, the bot searches its sources for an appropriate answer.

As the bot finds the answer, a real-time response is displayed to the user. Most responses also include a set of relevant references, which are shown after the complete response is received.

### There are two methods to install a Context Bot Modal on a site:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Click Event Launcher"
    href="/bots/installing-bots/click-event-launcher"
  ></Card>
  <Card
    title="Floating Launcher"
    href="/bots/installing-bots/floating-launcher"
  ></Card>
</Cards>
