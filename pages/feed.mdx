# Feed

The feed functions as a real-time stream capturing every query directed towards your Context bot. As users engage with your bot, the feed populates with their questions and the corresponding responses from the bot.

To access your feed, select the "Feed" button located in the navigation panel on the left.

This will display a list of the most recent queries, arranged in the order they were received. If a response was rated either as helpful or unhelpful, this feedback will be displayed alongside the respective query.

Click on any query to expand it, revealing the response delivered by Context, as well as a list of references. To collapse the query, simply click on it again.
