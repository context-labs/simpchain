# Bots

Bots are AI agents trained to comprehend your documentation and content, and provide answers to any type of query in a matter of seconds.

Once you've created a bot, it's [easy to integrate it across various platforms](/bots/installing-bots)â€”simply use an embed script to install it on any website, or follow our instructions to incorporate it into [Discord](/bots/installing-bots/discord-integration) or [Slack](/bots/installing-bots/slack-integration).

Additionally, Context allows for [real-time monitoring of bot queries](/bots/monitor-queries), providing you with valuable insights into the questions your users are directing at the bot.
