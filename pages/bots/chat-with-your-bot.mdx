# Chat With Your Bot

Once a bot is created, you can easily interact with it through the Context dashboard to test the quality of its responses.

To chat with your bot, click the "Bots" button in the left side navigation, choose the bot you want to interact with, and then click "Chat" in the top right corner of the screen.

This action will open the Context modal popup on your current screen. Type your queries into the chat window and submit them to the chatbot. Observe the bot's responses to evaluate its performance.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that querying your own bot will incur [query credits](/usage) and
  affect your usage.
