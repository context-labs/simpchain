# View Bot

Viewing a bot directs you to a dedicated static page where your bot resides. This page can be shared with others and can serve as a first-line customer support hub for your platform or website.

To view your bot, click the "Bots" button in the left side navigation, select the bot you wish to view, and then click "View" in the top right corner of the screen.

A new tab or window will open, displaying your bot. To share the bot with others, simply copy the URL and distribute it to your intended recipients.
