# Data Types

There are two types of sources in Context:

- [**Sitemaps**](#sitemaps)
- [**YouTube**](#youtube)

## Sitemaps

The Sitemap source type utilizes XML sitemap files to crawl an entire website and incorporate its content into a bot. To use this source type, you need access to a functional XML file without any errors.

## YouTube

The YouTube source type employs a YouTube channel, video, or playlist link as a source for the bot. Our platform subsequently scrapes all the videos and generates transcriptions. These transcriptions serve as the foundation for the bot's knowledge base.
