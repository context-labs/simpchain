# Quick Start

In this guide, we will guide you through setting up your Context account, creating a bot, and testing it.

Starting with Context is a breeze; it takes less than 5 minutes and requires no credit card. The free plan allows for up to 100 [documents](https://www.notion.so/Documents-d8a284dbd0c941e69d1dc32050e7921e), and also provides you with 50 [query credits](https://www.notion.so/Query-Credits-30bf8a3985604fe4b5476607e7f8c057) to test your bot, making Context accessible to everyone at no cost.
